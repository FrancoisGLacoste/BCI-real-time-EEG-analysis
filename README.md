# BCI-real-time-EEG-analysis


 EEG signal OR spectrogram shown in real-time via animation.

Show an animation chunk by chunk (and hopefully in real-time) of 
              1)   an EEG signal that is extracted from an EDF file. 
              2)   the spectrogram of the EEG, chunk by chunk in (hopefully) real-time   

FOR NOW:
- It works for already acquired multichannel EEG  : NOT REAL-TIME 

- THE REAL-TIME ANIMATION WORKS ONLY:
             - FOR SIGNAL WITH SINGLE CHANNEL. It should be extended to multichannel acquisition. 
             - When plotting  either the signal, OR the spectrogram, but not the both at the same time. 

I realize it already exists good library for this task: 
             So I take it as a programming exercise.
